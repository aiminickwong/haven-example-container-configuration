# Haven Container Configuration Examples

Haven allows storing of container configuration in Git repository (or in a config file) in YAML or properties formats. 
It lets the user quickly start (or scale) a new container without having to pass in the required settings every time. 
Configuration can vary for different clusters and image versions.

To learn more about Haven, visit the [Haven Readme](https://github.com/codeabovelab/haven-platform/blob/master/README.md) for the complete installation instruction and feature list.
